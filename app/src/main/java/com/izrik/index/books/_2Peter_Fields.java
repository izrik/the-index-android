    public static final String _2Peter_1_2 = "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_3 = "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_4 = "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_5 = "And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_6 = "And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_7 = "And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_8 = "For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. ";

    public static final String _2Peter_1_11 = "For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_12 = "Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know [them,] and be established in the present truth. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_13 = "Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_14 = "Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_15 = "Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_16 = "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_17 = "For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_18 = "And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_19 = "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_20 = "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_1_21 = "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_1 = "But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_2 = "And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_3 = "And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_4 = "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_5 = "And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person,] a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_6 = "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_7 = "And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_8 = "(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;) ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_9 = "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_10 = "But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous [are they,] selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_11 = "Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_12 = "But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_13 = "And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_14 = "Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_15 = "Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_16 = "But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_17 = "These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_18 = "For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_19 = "While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_20 = "For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_21 = "For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it,] to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_2_22 = "But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_1 = "This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in [both] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_2 = "That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_3 = "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_4 = "And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_5 = "For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_6 = "Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_7 = "But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_8 = "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_9 = "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_10 = "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_11 = "[Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness, ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_12 = "Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_13 = "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_14 = "Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_15 = "And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord [is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_16 = "As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_17 = "Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. ";
    public static final String _2Peter_3_18 = "But grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and for ever. Amen. ";
