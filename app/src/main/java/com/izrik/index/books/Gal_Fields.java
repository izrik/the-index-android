";

    public static final String Gal_3_16 = "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_17 = "And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_18 = "For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_19 = "Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_20 = "Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_21 = "[Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_22 = "But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_23 = "But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_24 = "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_25 = "But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. ";
    public static final String Gal_3_26 = "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. ";

    public static final String Gal_4_2 = "But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_3 = "Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: ";
    public static final String Gal_4_4 = "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, ";
    public static final String Gal_4_5 = "To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_6 = "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_7 = "Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_8 = "Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_9 = "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? ";
    public static final String Gal_4_10 = "Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_11 = "I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_12 = "Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am;] for I [am] as ye [are:] ye have not injured me at all. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_13 = "Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_14 = "And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_15 = "Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_16 = "Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? ";
    public static final String Gal_4_17 = "They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_18 = "But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing,] and not only when I am present with you. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_19 = "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, ";
    public static final String Gal_4_20 = "I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_21 = "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? ";
    public static final String Gal_4_22 = "For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_23 = "But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_24 = "Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_25 = "For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_26 = "But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_27 = "For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_28 = "Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_29 = "But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_30 = "Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. ";
    public static final String Gal_4_31 = "So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_1 = "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_2 = "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_3 = "For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_4 = "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_5 = "For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_6 = "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_7 = "Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? ";
    public static final String Gal_5_8 = "This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_9 = "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_10 = "I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_11 = "And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_12 = "I would they were even cut off which trouble you. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_13 = "For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_14 = "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_15 = "But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_16 = "[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_17 = "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_18 = "But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_19 = "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these;] Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, ";
    public static final String Gal_5_20 = "Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, ";
    public static final String Gal_5_21 = "Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_22 = "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, ";
    public static final String Gal_5_23 = "Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_24 = "And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_25 = "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. ";
    public static final String Gal_5_26 = "Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_1 = "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_2 = "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_3 = "For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_4 = "But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_5 = "For every man shall bear his own burden. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_6 = "Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_7 = "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_8 = "For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_9 = "And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_10 = "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially unto them who are of the household of faith. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_11 = "Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_12 = "As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_13 = "For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_14 = "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_15 = "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_16 = "And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. ";
    public static final String Gal_6_17 = "From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. ";
