    public static final String Rom_5_5 = "And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ";

    public static final String Rom_6_19 = "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. ";
    public static final String Rom_6_20 = "For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. ";
    public static final String Rom_6_21 = "What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death. ";
    public static final String Rom_6_22 = "But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. ";
    public static final String Rom_6_23 = "For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. ";

    public static final String Rom_7_2 = "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband. ";
    public static final String Rom_7_3 = "So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. ";
    public static final String Rom_7_4 = "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. ";

    public static final String Rom_7_6 = "But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter. ";
    public static final String Rom_7_7 = "What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. ";
    public static final String Rom_7_8 = "But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead. ";

    public static final String Rom_7_10 = "And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death. ";
    public static final String Rom_7_11 = "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me. ]";
