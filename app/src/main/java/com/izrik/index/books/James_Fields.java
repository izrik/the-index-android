    public static final String James_1_2 = "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; ";
    public static final String James_1_3 = "Knowing [this,] that the trying of your faith worketh patience. ";
    public static final String James_1_4 = "But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. ";
    public static final String James_1_5 = "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. ";
    public static final String James_1_6 = "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. ";
    public static final String James_1_7 = "For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. ";
    public static final String James_1_8 = "A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways. ";
    public static final String James_1_9 = "Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: ";
    public static final String James_1_10 = "But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. ";
    public static final String James_1_11 = "For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. ";
    public static final String James_1_12 = "Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. ";
    public static final String James_1_13 = "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: ";
    public static final String James_1_14 = "But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. ";
    public static final String James_1_15 = "Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. ";
    public static final String James_1_16 = "Do not err, my beloved brethren. ";
    public static final String James_1_17 = "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. ";
    public static final String James_1_18 = "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. ";
    public static final String James_1_19 = "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: ";
    public static final String James_1_20 = "For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. ";
    public static final String James_1_21 = "Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. ";
    public static final String James_1_22 = "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. ";
    public static final String James_1_23 = "For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: ";
    public static final String James_1_24 = "For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. ";
    public static final String James_1_25 = "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein,] he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. ";
    public static final String James_1_26 = "If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain. ";
    public static final String James_1_27 = "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world. ";
    public static final String James_2_1 = "My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons. ";
    public static final String James_2_2 = "For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; ";
    public static final String James_2_3 = "And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: ";
    public static final String James_2_4 = "Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? ";
    public static final String James_2_5 = "Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? ";
    public static final String James_2_6 = "But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? ";
    public static final String James_2_7 = "Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? ";
    public static final String James_2_8 = "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: ";
    public static final String James_2_9 = "But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. ";
    public static final String James_2_10 = "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point,] he is guilty of all. ";
    public static final String James_2_11 = "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. ";
    public static final String James_2_12 = "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. ";
    public static final String James_2_13 = "For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. ";
    public static final String James_2_14 = "What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? ";
    public static final String James_2_15 = "If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, ";
    public static final String James_2_16 = "And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit? ";
    public static final String James_2_17 = "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. ";
    public static final String James_2_18 = "Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. ";
    public static final String James_2_19 = "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. ";
    public static final String James_2_20 = "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? ";
    public static final String James_2_21 = "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? ";
    public static final String James_2_22 = "Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? ";
    public static final String James_2_23 = "And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. ";
    public static final String James_2_24 = "Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. ";
    public static final String James_2_25 = "Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way? ";
    public static final String James_2_26 = "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. ";
    public static final String James_3_1 = "My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. ";
    public static final String James_3_2 = "For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body. ";
    public static final String James_3_3 = "Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. ";
    public static final String James_3_4 = "Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. ";
    public static final String James_3_5 = "Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! ";
    public static final String James_3_6 = "And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. ";
    public static final String James_3_7 = "For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: ";
    public static final String James_3_8 = "But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. ";
    public static final String James_3_9 = "Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. ";
    public static final String James_3_10 = "Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. ";
    public static final String James_3_11 = "Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter? ";
    public static final String James_3_12 = "Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. ";
    public static final String James_3_13 = "Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. ";
    public static final String James_3_14 = "But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. ";
    public static final String James_3_15 = "This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish. ";
    public static final String James_3_16 = "For where envying and strife [is,] there [is] confusion and every evil work. ";
    public static final String James_3_17 = "But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. ";
    public static final String James_3_18 = "And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. ";
    public static final String James_4_1 = "From whence [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members? ";
    public static final String James_4_2 = "Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. ";
    public static final String James_4_3 = "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts. ";
    public static final String James_4_4 = "Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. ";
    public static final String James_4_5 = "Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? ";
    public static final String James_4_6 = "But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. ";
    public static final String James_4_7 = "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. ";
    public static final String James_4_8 = "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded. ";
    public static final String James_4_9 = "Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness. ";
    public static final String James_4_10 = "Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. ";
    public static final String James_4_11 = "Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. ";
    public static final String James_4_12 = "There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? ";
    public static final String James_4_13 = "Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: ";
    public static final String James_4_14 = "Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. ";
    public static final String James_4_15 = "For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. ";
    public static final String James_4_16 = "But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. ";
    public static final String James_4_17 = "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin. ";

    public static final String James_5_3 = "Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. ";
    public static final String James_5_4 = "Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. ";

    public static final String James_5_6 = "Ye have condemned [and] killed the just; [and] he doth not resist you. ";
    public static final String James_5_7 = "Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. ";

    public static final String James_5_10 = "Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. ";
    public static final String James_5_11 = "Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. ";
    public static final String James_5_12 = "But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. ";

    public static final String James_5_15 = "And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. ";
    public static final String James_5_16 = "Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. ";

    public static final String James_5_18 = "And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. ";
    public static final String James_5_19 = "Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; ";
    public static final String James_5_20 = "Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. ";
